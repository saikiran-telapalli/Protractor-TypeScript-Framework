Protractor : https://www.protractortest.org/#/

1. Download & Install node js
2. Set the system variable path
3. Check node -v, npm -v
4. Install Protractor nam install -g protractor
This will install two command line tools, protractor and webdriver-manager. Try running protractor --version to make sure it's working.
You can find path:	Urs/Sai/ApData/Roaming/
5.  webdriver-manager update
6.  Now start up a server with webdriver-manager start

This will start up a Selenium Server and will output a bunch of info logs. Your Protractor test will send requests to this server to control a local browser. You can see information about the status of the server at http://localhost:4444/wd/hub.

7. Type script Framework
    1. Visual studio
    2. Create a folder in local and open form VS code
    3. Create a package.json from terminal npm init
    4. Observe nodes_modules folder created
    5. Add protractor dependencies from terminal nam install protractor
    6. Add type script dependencies from —> https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/5.4.1/exampleTypescript/package.json
    7. And run npm install from terminal then above dependencies will be added to nodes_modules
    8. Create configuration.ts https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/5.4.1/exampleTypescript/conf.ts
    9. Create spec.ts having describe and it, also make sure to import 
        1. Reference for above two steps for modification as like https://www.protractortest.org/#/api-overview
    10. Intall Typescript global nam install -g typescript
    11. Protractor can run only .js file, to convert ts to js 
        1. we need to run tsc —init, It creates tsconfig.json exclude non req files/modify the file
        2. Run tsc from terminal
        3. Observe the output dir folder create with the name given in tsconfig.json
        4. Now the run the command protractor dirName/configuration.js
        5. It will start execution
    12. Create pageObject class 
        1. Class should have constructor, with proper name:ElementFinder
        2. Import required element, by, etc.,
        3. Export should be at prefix of that class
    13. Create an object of that class using let rename
    14. Modify the elements with rename and call those properties
    15. To overcome “protractor dirName/configuration.js” from terminal every time
        1. Go to package.json and add the same in test under scripts key
        2. Then run npm run test
        3. We cal also add pretest key in the same scripts which will include “ttsc” command to compile, this runs before test
        4. See execution starts
    16. Let is used instead of var in typescript for sync purpose which can also be restricted to type as below
            1. let a:string=“hello”
            2. let b:number=4;
            3. let c:any=“say”; (any accepts any type of value)
            4. let flag:boolean=false;
    17. Const will make the variable strict means we cannot change the value assigned to that variable

Firstly, when downloading the ProtractorTypeScriptCucumber.zip from the course, make sure to delete the node_modules folder and re-install it using "npm install" in the same location.
After that, open the package.json file and make sure the below line of code is present in it:
"webdriver-update": "./node_modules/protractor/bin/webdriver-manager update"
Now, run "npm run webdriver-update" command. Finally, run "npm run test" command. It should work fine.

Solution: ./node_modules/protractor/bin/webdriver-manager update --versions.chrome 2.35 in terminal

SolutionInCase: ”webdriver-manager": "~12.1.8" in package.json

18. Export should be defined for a class in order to use the methods defined in it creating an object in other file
19. Also import that class with path in the file used the object
20.  Functions can be defined with return type and called at last in the same file like below
        1. function validate(value:number):number{ value+1; }
        2. And we call as —> validate(2);
        
        
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Simple steps:
      npm init creates package.json
      npm --init creates tsconfig.json
      run this cmd if chrome browser not invoked node ./node_modules/protractor/bin/webdriver-manager update
      
      
******************Is it possible to navigate from feature file to step definition in VSCode**************************

1. Press Ctrl + , to open User Settings

2. Scroll down to Cucumber Auto Complete update this in steps edit settings.json

  {
    "cucumberautocomplete.steps": [
    

        "stepDefinations/*.ts"
    ],
    "cucumberautocomplete.syncfeatures": "features/*.feature"
}

Reload VSCode

Open a .feature file and right click any step, you should have Go To Definition and Peek Definition working.
